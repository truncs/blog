Generalist with a wide range of experience from engineering to product management, driven more by the purpose than the credentials.
 
In the past, I led the overall strategy of places at Uber. Places - human speak for latitude and longitude, includes search, detecting the current place, destination prediction (are you going to your favorite restaurant or gym), personalization (home/work) and collecting ground truth data. I love basing a strategy on first principles and math rather than intuition. Also a fan of having unbiased measures of gauging whether the strategy worked/is-working or not.

These days, I work with robots. My hope is that in the long run, robots will help us get to places where our physical embodiment can't.
